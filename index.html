    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
Dr. Ying Tu is a visiting researcher in the Department of Life Sciences and a senior scientist at Randox Health. He was awarded a Ph.D. degree from Queen Mary University of London in 2019. Prior to joining Imperial, he was a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Xuefeng Wang at Iowa State University.

Dr. Tu has rich experience in multiple disciplines including biophysics, synthetic biology, materials sciences and chemistry. His research interests are electrochemical and fluorescent biosensors that map cellular force in molecular level in-vivo or in-vitro, detect biochemical information, and monitor the process of bioreaction. Currently, he is developing a DNA-based biosensor platform to measure forces produced by cells with a high-throughput technique.

Ying cofounded a Gunnersbury Athletic Football Club (known as GA or GAFC) serving the local community in west London. https://gunnersburyfc.com/
